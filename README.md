#### Course Description

> This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for
> summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal
> modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex
> statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for
> eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that
> can be addressed by the data. We cover in detail the plotting systems
> in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data
> graphics. We also cover some of the common multivariate statistical
> techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

#### Course Syllabus

-   Making exploratory graphs
-   Principles of analytic graphics
-   Plotting systems and graphics devices in R
-   The base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R
-   Clustering methods
-   Dimension reduction techniques

#### Course Textbook

The book [📔 Exploratory Data Analysis with
R](./book/exploratory-data-analysis-with-r.pdf) covers the lecture
material in this course.
